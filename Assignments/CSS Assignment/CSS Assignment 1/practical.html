    <h1>CSS Text Styling Practice</h1>

    <p>
        This is a simple example to test text styling with CSS. The paragraph uses a navy 
        color and justified alignment, which makes both sides of the text look neat. The 
        heading above is centered and slightly larger to stand out from the body text.
    </p>

    <p>
        On smaller screens, the layout adjusts for better readability. For example, the 
        text becomes left-aligned and the font sizes shrink a bit. This helps keep the 
        design readable across devices without adding complexity.
